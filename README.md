# React/Redux SoundCloud Client

This project is a basic front-end SoundCloud client built using React and Redux. After logging in, the application consumes data from the SoundCloud API to render tracks on the user's page. It enables the user to see their most recent favorited tracks as well as play them.

## Usage

This project can easily be added as a feature to other web applications built with React. Users are authenticated via SoundCloud.

## Future

This application was built following a tutorial as a personal introduction to React. That being said, there is a lot of room for expansion and improvement.

Future improvements/features include:
-Better UI via styling and context
-Better audio control (vol +/-, play/pause, continuous play, shuffle)
-Integration into more immersive web experiences.

## Tutorial/Inspiration

I highly recommend this tutorial to anyone interested in learn React/Redux or
looking for an introduction into lightweight MVC frameworks:
